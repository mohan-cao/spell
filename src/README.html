<p>Installation instructions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Unzip the file into any directory you wish</li>
<li>Open the <code>exec.sh</code> file. Set up is automatic.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="features">Features:</h2>



<h3 id="first-time-run">First time run:</h3>

<p>Choose levels to unlock up to. This will be for the default list only.</p>



<h3 id="main-menu">Main menu:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The button "New game" leads to a level select menu where you can select a level to initiate a quiz.</li>
<li>The button "Review" to go to level menu to review previously failed words</li>
<li>The button "Statistics" to check statistics of words.</li>
<li>The button "Settings" to mute background music and to set word lists (must be in format of default list), and to change default voice (you can always change voice later in quiz).</li>
</ul>

<p>Dynamic background fetching from an open-source image API is possible with an <strong>internet connection</strong> only.</p>



<h3 id="level-menu">Level menu:</h3>

<p>Select a level to make a game. Hovering over levels currently displays MASTERY of words in that level, but will in future display your personal best highscore.</p>



<h3 id="quiz-game">Quiz game:</h3>

<p>Enter words in the text area, then confirm your word with the ENTER key or by pressing the Confirm button. You cannot type nothing, which will give you a warning, or type excessively much, but there is no limit to number of characters typed.</p>

<p>Currently, all letters in a-z, A-Z, ' (apostrophe), _ (space), and - (hyphen) are allowed.</p>

<p>You are given your high score, personal best, and maximum possible score on the top. Currently, beating your personal best does not give a reward.</p>

<p>Hover over the icons on the right to get a tooltip of what they do. (They are buttons for changing the voice, and repeating the word)</p>

<p>You can also get the word definition (actually a word example) with the "Get word definition" button. <strong>This requires an active internet connection to work, as it is dynamically fetched from an API.</strong></p>



<h3 id="statistics">Statistics:</h3>

<p>You can see a barchart of overall word statistics, and a table of all words completed.</p>

<p>You can filter by level or word, and the table gives you a detailed description of what words you are most comfortable with and those that you struggle with by simply pressing the headings to order the table headings.</p>

<p>You can also clear statistics using the 'Clear Stats' button.</p>



<h3 id="settings">Settings:</h3>

<p>Buttons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mute background music</li>
<li>Set word list <br>
<ul><li>All lists that have been loaded are initialised with unlocked level 1 only.</li>
<li>There is no option to load files of a different format to that of the NZCER spelling list.</li>
<li>Don't worry about moving word lists around accidentally: as long as you can relocate the same list with the file chooser, you can play the same file. Coincidentally, this means that two different spelling lists with the same name will have their stats merged.</li></ul></li>
<li>Set default voice <br>
<ul><li>Currently, the voices are not very human-readable. Still, a list of possible voices can be generated (not sure if all of them work though, but the default works and the nz voice works)</li></ul></li>
</ul>
